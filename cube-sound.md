The interface is composed of three layers: bottom, middle and top.

Each cube represents a music note of FM synth, following a traditional keyboard layout.

In the middle layer, starting from the **pink** cube as C4, in the anti-clockwise direction, following C4#, D4, D4#, etc. This changes the modulation frequency.

While the upper and lower layers provide notes which changes the carrier frequency.

As shown in the second picture, you can use you fingers to trigger this notes to play.

For task 2 and 3, you will be asked to follow color patterns with text info to complete designed tasks.
